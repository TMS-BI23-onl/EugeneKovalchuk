Well done!

Please, organize your folder structure. It's hard to guess which file is which homework. :)

HW2

file 1 - task 4
Your solution is incorrect. I was asking for all rows where EmailPromotion is not = 2, and you gave me only 1.

file 4 - task 1
The task was "including 1", not "equals to 1". And your boundaries are even wider. 
We discussed solution for this task at previous lesson3, please take a look.

Also, russian comments can't be read.
